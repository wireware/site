NI (formerly National Instruments) offers a rich platform for rapid systems development with maximum flexibility. It consists of software tools and hardware products, including the LabVIEW development environment, data acquisition (DAQ) instruments, and programmable controllers.

NI hardware is designed to be extremely modular and robust. The same product can be redeployed in a wide range of applications, making it an excellent investment.

LabVIEW is a graphical programming language intuitive to non-programmers relying on a wiring-diagram paradigm. The application environment interfaces seamlessly with other NI products and third-party hardware alike.
