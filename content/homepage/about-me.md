I have over six years experience working with NI products including LabVIEW and cDAQ instrumentation in a laboratory setting. I am also proficient in Python programming and web development. In 2016, I earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Ohio State. Besides working on projects for WIREWARE, I am currently pursuing graduate studies in cognitive science.
